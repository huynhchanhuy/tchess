Building web based Chess game using Symfony 2 Components: Http Foundation and
Http Kernel
========================================================

What is Symfony2 components?
-----------------

Symfony2 component is standalone, decoupled, cohesive PHP library that is used
many places in Symfony2 full-stack framework. If we are writing a web
application that only use some components, you can combine these components
together instead of using the whole Symfony2 full-stack. In this series, we
will learn how to use and combine these low level components to build a web
based Chess game. Each article in the series show you how to use each component
separately, and how to combine with other component.

Before we start
------------

We need prepare some things before reading the series:

 * Recent version of PHP (5.3.8 or later is good enough).

 * A web server (like Apache). In the demo code, there is an example of a
   virtual host file that you can use it right away.

 * A good knowledge of PHP and understanding of Object Oriented programming.

Writing first application
-------------------------

Let started by writing a simple index.php file. Here is the content:

```
<?php
// web/index.php

$input = $_GET['name'];

printf('Hello %s', $input);
```

In this case, we use global variable directly. This code is not secure, and not
easy to test. Http Foundation is a component that deal with HTTP specification.
It provide 2 classes: Request and Response that replace alot of global variables
($_GET, $_POST, $_FILE, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION, ...) and functions (echo, header,
setcookie, ...)

Http Foundation
---------------

We need to create composer.json file and add dependency for the project:

```
# composer.json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/class-loader": "2.1.*",
        "symfony/http-foundation": "2.1.*"
    }
}
```

Now, let's rewrite index.php using the Request and the Response classes:

```
<php

// web/index.php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Session;

$request = Request::createFromGlobals();

// Prepare session.
if (!$request->getSession()) {
    $session = new Session();
    $session->start();
    $request->setSession($session);
}

$response = $sc->get('framework')->handle($request);

$response->send();

$sc->get('framework')->terminate($request, $response);
```

The createFromGlobals() method creates a Request object based on the current
PHP global variables. And then we send this request object to the framework.
The way we create the framework object is a bit strange, and I'll cover it in
the Dependency Injection article. After handling the request, the framework
return the response object. We'll need to send the response's content (html
markup, json, ...) to client. Depend on the application, sometimes we need to
do some things that not related to the response's content, such as sending
an email, logging user action, run cron... Those actions will be run by calling
terminate method of framework, right after we send the response.

Http Kernel
-----------

Actually, the framework is quite simple for now. It is an object of class
Framework, that extends directly from HttpKernel. We need
a Controller to handle a request. But in a huge project, we have a lot of
Controller to handle different requests. Http Kernel is the way web application
handling the request until it return the response, include finding
and calling the right Controller base on the request we have.

[<img src="http://symfony.com/doc/current/_images/09-controller-returns-response.png">](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel/introduction.html)

```
$dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
$resolver = new ControllerResolver();
$kernel = new HttpKernel($dispatcher, $resolver);
$response = $kernel->handle($request);
```

This is the way we create framework (kernel) object. All of harded parts are
handled by kernel by itself, so we don't need to worry about that. All we need
to do is creating new Controller to handle the request we expect.

```
namespace Tchess\Controller;

class GameController
{

    /**
     * Move a piece.
     *
     * @param \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request $request
     * @return Response
     */
    public function moveAction(Request $request)
    {
        return new Response('Piece has been moved');
    }
}
```
