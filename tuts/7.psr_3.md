Building Chess game using Symfony 2 Components: PSR-3
========================================================

What is PSR-3?
-----------------

PSR-3 is an standard of logging in PHP. There 2 interfaces and 1 class defined
in PSR-3. They are: LoggerInterface, LoggerAwareInterface and LogLevel. There
are some logging library out there, and if we choose a library compatible with
PSR-3, we can reuse our code in other place without worry about compatible
between logging libraries.

In our application, we need to log every piece move. We use monolog because it
compatible with PSR-3.

Let started
------------

Let update our composer.json:

```
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.10.0",
    }
}
```

Then create logger services using service container:

```php
<?php
$sc->register('logger', 'Monolog\Logger')
        ->setArguments(array('moves'))
        ->addMethodCall('pushHandler', array(new Reference('logger_stream_handler')))
;
$sc->register('logger_stream_handler', 'Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler')
        ->setArguments(array(__DIR__ . '/../logs/moves.log', Logger::INFO));
```

All the moves will be logged into moves.log file inside logs directory.

We won't do logging inside moveAction of GameController, because it is not
the job of controller, and it will delay the content rendering to the user.
We need logging after content rendered. Listen to KernelEvents::TERMINATE event
is the best place to do this. Let add a subscriber:

```php
<?php
public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    KernelEvents::TERMINATE => array('onKernelTerminateLogMoves', -1024),
}

public function onKernelTerminateLogMoves(PostResponseEvent $event)
{
    // ...
}
```

But how can we know which move was performed? There is a trick. We will create
another service called move_manager. This service will hold the moves during
the request processing. And then in the terminate event, we will load all moves
to log, one by one:

```php
<?php
public function moveAction(Request $request)
{
    // ...
    $this->framework->getMoveManager()->addMove($move);
}

public function onKernelTerminateLogMoves(PostResponseEvent $event)
{
    $moves = $this->move_manager->getMoves();

    if (empty($moves)) {
        return;
    }

    foreach ($moves as $move) {
        $this->logger->info(sprintf("Player '%s' has moved a piece from '%s' to '%s'", $move->getColor(), $move->getSource(), $move->getTarget()));
    }
}
```
