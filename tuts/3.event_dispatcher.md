Building Chess game using Symfony 2 Components: Event Dispatcher
========================================================

What is Event Dispatcher?
-----------------

In the chess game, there are a lot of rules to deal with. Some of those rules
maybe removed some days. Some other rules will be added. Our application must
be flexible enough to handle plug-and-play rules. Now is the time
Symfony 2 Event Dispatcher component will be useful.

First we need to know about 3 terms: listener, subscriber and dispatcher.
Listener is a service that listen to a particular event. When an event is
happened, that listener will be called. A listener can be used to listen to
some kind of different events, but it is not recommended. We can use subscriber
to archive this. Finally, a dispatcher is used to attached listeners and
subscribers into it, and then at a particular place, after the event happening,
we use dispatcher to trigger that event.

Let started
------------

Let update our composer.json:

```
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/class-loader": "2.5.*",
        "symfony/http-foundation": "2.5.*",
        "symfony/routing": "2.5.*",
        "symfony/http-kernel": "2.5.*",
        "symfony/event-dispatcher": "2.5.*"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "Tchess": "src/" }
    }
}
```

We have already created dispatcher service, so now we can get the service
definition and modify it:

```php
<?php
$callable = function(Event $event) use ($sc) {
    $sc->get('logger')->info('Player has started the game');
};

$sc->register('rules.king', 'Tchess\Rule\KingRules');

$sc->getDefinition('dispatcher')
    ->addMethodCall('addListener', array(GameEvents::START, $callable))
    ->addMethodCall('addSubscriber', array(new Reference('rules.king')));
```

$callable is a listener that has listened to GameEvents::START event. When a player
started a game, dispatcher will trigger GameEvents::START event by calling:

```php
<?php
$sc->get('dispatcher')->dispatch(GameEvents::START, new GameEvent($player, $em));
```

And $callable will receive GameEvent event object.

To make it easier to manager event listeners, subscriber is used to listen to
a group of events, and then it can handle or transfer the event to other
service.

```php
<?php
// src/container.php

class KingRules implements EventSubscriberInterface
{

    public function onMoveDoCastling(MoveEvent $event)
    {
        $move = $event->getMove();
        $board = $$->getBoard();
        list($newRow, $newColumn) = Move::getIndex($move->getTarget());
        $piece = $board->getPiece($newRow, $newColumn);

        // Do castling.
        $piece->setCastled(true);
    }

    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            MoveEvents::MOVE => array(array('onMoveDoCastling', 0)),
        );
    }

}
```

Some notes:
 * We can set the priority of the listener (methods in subscriber) by passing
   a number. The higher number will made the lister more important, and it will
   be called first in the listener chain.
 * We can create any event class you like, but it must extends
   Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Event class.

Stopping event flow/Propagation
-------------------------------

It is not necessary checking all rules if one of those rule was broke, we need
to stop the event flow right away after we found that a rule is broke. To do
that, we call a method like this:

```php
<?php
$event->stopPropagation();
```

By doing this, none of rules with lower priority will be called any more, and
we will be returned to the place we dispatch the event.

Checking the event after dispatching
------------------------------------

In the listener, we can change some values of the event, and then after
dispatching the event, we can access values of the event. Moreover, we can
check that the event flow has been propagation stopped or not:

```php
<?php
$event = new SomeEvent();
$dispatcher->dispatch('foo.event', $event);
if ($event->get('foo') && $event->stopPropagation()) {
    // Do some things.
}
```
