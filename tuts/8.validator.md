Building Chess game using Symfony 2 Components: Validator
========================================================

What is Validator?
-----------------

When player want to move a piece from a square to another square, we have to
validate that move before moving the piece. E.g. White player want to move a
piece 'a2 a3'. First we need to check if there is a piece in a2, then check
the color of that piece, what type that piece is, and check all the rules that
piece has, etc. Previously, we use event dispatcher to implement the validation.
But it is not designed to do that job. And we need to add some methods to
the event to set message, and the value (valid or not). Validator component
is designed to help us solve this problem.

We must define rules (or constraints) that the object must follow in order to
be valid. An example of constraint is: color must be black or white. That
constraint is an instance of Choice constraint that is available in symfony. 
Other available constraints are True, False, Range, Email, Type etc. You can
define other constraint as your need. A constraint can be applied to a target.
Currently we have 3 targets: property, public getter method, and class. In the
above example, color constraint is applied to a property, because color
constraint is about color, not related to other property. If we want to validate
a move, we need a constraint that is applied to a public getter method, or a
class, because we need to test the logic that is much more complex.

Let started
------------

Let update our composer.json:

```
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/validator": "v2.6.4"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "Tchess": "src/" }
    }
}
```

In container builder, we need to create 2 new services:

```php
$sc->register('validator')
        ->setClass('%validator.class%')
        ->setFactoryService(new Reference('validator.builder'))
        ->setFactoryMethod('getValidator');

$sc->register('constraint_validator.move', 'Tchess\Validator\Constraints\MoveValidator')
        ->addTag('validator.constraint_validator', array('alias' => 'constraint_validator.move'))
        ->setScope('prototype');
```

'validator' service is used to validate our move object, while
'constraint_validator.move' service is use to validate move object by using
move constraint. We can take a look at 'constraint_validator.move' service
later. Let see what 'validator' service can do. In the
GameController::moveAction controller, we create a move, and then validate it:

```php
<?php
$move = new Move($board, $color, $request->request->get('move'));

$errors = $validator->validate($move);
if (count($errors) == 0) {
    $board->movePiece($move->getSource(), $move->getTarget());
    // ...
}
```

Currently, the Move class does not have any constraints, so the move is always
valid. We need to add some constraints to Move class:

```php
<?php

/**
 * @TchessAssert\Move
 */
class Move
{
    /**
     * @Assert\Choice(callback = "getColors")
     */
    protected $color;

    /**
     * @Assert\Regex("/^[a-h][1-8]$/")
     */
    protected $source;

    /**
     * @Assert\Regex("/^[a-h][1-8]$/")
     */
    protected $target;
}
```

Constraints are defined in various ways: YAML, XML, annotations, or PHP. In this
application, we only define in annotation, but you can defined them in other
way.

We use 2 built-in constraints: Choice and Regex. Firstly, the $color property
must be in a list of colors, that is returned by getColors() callback. Next,
the $source and $target properties must match an expression, for example a2.
But in the chess game, there are a lot of rules that can not be defined in the
property. We need to defined a new constraint: Move constraint, that will
deal with chess's rules.

```php
<?php

namespace Tchess\Validator\Constraints;

use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraint;

/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class Move extends Constraint
{
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function validatedBy()
    {
        return 'constraint_validator.move';
    }

    public function getTargets()
    {
        return self::CLASS_CONSTRAINT;
    }
}
```

Define a constraint is quite easy. Just notice the target of the constraint.
A constraint can be applied to some targets. In this case, our move constraint
only target to a class. Here is how we can define multiple targets.

```php
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class Move extends Constraint
{
    public function getTargets()
    {
        return array(
            self::CLASS_CONSTRAINT,
            self::PROPERTY_CONSTRAINT,
        );
    }
}
```

A constraint can not validate itself. It must be validated by another class,
called constraint validator. A constraint validator can be a class, or a
service. In our constraint, we use a service. If it's not specific, a default
class 'MoveValidator' is used, as bellow.

```php
public function validatedBy()
{
    return get_class($this).'Validator';
}
```

The constraint validator class do very easy job: loop through each rule, and
pass the move object to it. If any rule rise a message, it capture it and put it
to it's context.

```php
<?php
namespace Tchess\Validator\Constraints;

use Tchess\Entity\Piece\Move as MoveEntity;

class MoveValidator extends ConstraintValidator implements MoveValidatorInterface
{
    private $rules = array();

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function validate($move, Constraint $constraint)
    {
        if (!$constraint instanceof Move) {
            throw new UnexpectedTypeException($constraint, __NAMESPACE__.'\Move');
        }

        if (!$move instanceof MoveEntity) {
            throw new UnexpectedTypeException($move, 'Tchess\Entity\Piece\Move\Move');
        }

        krsort($this->rules);
        foreach ($this->rules as $priority => $rules) {
            foreach ($rules as $rule) {
                $message = call_user_func($rule, $move);
                if (!empty($message)) {
                    $this->context->buildViolation($message)
                        // Currently we do not support parameters in message.
                        //->setParameter('%string%', $value)
                        ->addViolation();
                    // Stop propagation.
                    break 2;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now take a look at 'constraint_validator.move' service which we defined. We can
see it's scope is prototype. The reason is, if the constraint validator is a
service, it's context can be override if we use the validator service to
validate object multiple time recursively. So we need to set scope of constraint
validator service to prototype, so that every time it is called, new instance
will be created, so the context is not override. The best practice is, every
time we have a constraint validator as a service, always set it's scope to
prototype.
